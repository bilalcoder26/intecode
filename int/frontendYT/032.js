console.log(20+ 30+ '10'); //5010

/*
Addition of Numbers (20 + 30):

The first operation is between two numbers, so 20 + 30 evaluates to 50.
Concatenation with String (50 + '10'):

When a number is added to a string, the number is coerced into a string, 
and the operation becomes string concatenation.
50 + '10' results in the string "5010".
Output:

The final result is the string "5010".
