console.log(typeof typeof 1);// string

/*
Here's an explanation of the statement console.log(typeof typeof 1);:

First typeof 1:

The typeof operator is used to determine the type of its operand.
Here, 1 is a number, so typeof 1 evaluates to the string "number".
Second typeof:

Now, typeof "number" is evaluated. Since "number" is a string, typeof "number" returns "string".
Final Output:

The result of the entire expression is "string", which is then logged to the console.
