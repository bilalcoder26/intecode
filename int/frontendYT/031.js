/*
The Spread Operator (...):

The spread operator (...) is used to expand an iterable (like a string, array, or object) into 
individual elements.
In this case, the string "Apple" is an iterable. Strings are treated as sequences of characters.
String to Array Conversion:

The spread operator breaks the string "Apple" into its individual characters: "A", "p", "p", "l", and "e".
These characters are then placed inside a new array: ["A", "p", "p", "l", "e"].
The data Variable:

The data variable is assigned this new array created using the spread operator.
console.log(data):
