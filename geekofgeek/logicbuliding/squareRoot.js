/*
Given a positive integer n, find its square root. If n is not a perfect square, then return floor of âˆšn.

Examples : 

Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2.


Input: n = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: The square root of 11 lies in between 3 and 4 so floor of the square root is 3.
