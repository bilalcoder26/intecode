/*
Given the number n (n >=0), find its factorial. Factorial of n is defined as 1 x 2 x â€¦ x n. For n = 0, factorial is 1. 
We are going to discuss iterative and recursive programs in this post.

Examples:

Input: n = 5
Output: 120
Explanation: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120


Input: n = 4
Output: 24
Explanation: 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24


Input: n = 0
Output: 1


Input: n = 1
Output: 1
*/

function factorial(num){
    if(num ===0) return 1
    return num * factorial(num-1);

}
console.log(factorial(5))
